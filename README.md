# Object-Tracking-based-cross-correlation-using-matlab
The work is developed on the basis of previous published paper "Robust estimation of similarity transformation for visual object
tracking" in Feb 2019. We implemented the purposed LDES tracker onto the real time camera. First we draw a rectangle on the camera scene, then the tracker will trace the object in the rectangle, including scaling and rotating.

The work is done by matlab language.

Note: opencv 3.4 installation is required
